I did not have to reach too far. I think the point of an interview is to get to know someone. I have known Helen Dalton for two years, however my interview enabled me to get to know her better. In interviewing Helen many of my previous thoughts and impressions were confirmed. I also chose to interview Helen because there are many things I have wondered about concerning her, her family, and what it was like for her growing up. It was nice to learn this information. I find that by learning about the people with whom you associate communication is a lot easier and more comfortable.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;(Handwritten note: good attitude)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
