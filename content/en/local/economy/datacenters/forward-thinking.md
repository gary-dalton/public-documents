> *How Strategic Partnerships Around Data Centers Can Transform the State’s Future*

---

## Overview

Wisconsin stands at a turning point. The arrival of major data center proposals—Microsoft, Meta, Vantage/OpenAI/Oracle—offers more than economic development. If approached strategically, these projects can help Wisconsin build long-term strength in digital skill, public-sector modernization, community resilience, and technological leadership.

This document outlines the **core benefits** Wisconsin gains by taking a thoughtful, partnership-based stance toward data center development.

---

## 1. Wisconsin Becomes a Future-Ready, Innovation-Oriented State

Approaching data centers as catalysts—not just buildings—positions Wisconsin as:

* a **national leader** in responsible technology adoption
* a state prepared for the **AI-driven economy**
* a place that attracts long-term investment in emerging sectors
* a region capable of influencing national debates on AI governance and digital infrastructure

This enhances Wisconsin’s reputation and competitiveness.

---

## 2. Stronger Digital Resilience Across the State

By building digital literacy, compute access, and modern infrastructure:

* governments become more capable and efficient
* schools and libraries gain access to essential tools
* communities develop stronger misinformation and cybersecurity defenses
* the entire state becomes less vulnerable to technology disruptions

This improves stability for both rural and urban areas.

---

## 3. A More Skilled, More Competitive Workforce

Through partnerships with data center operators:

* technical colleges gain new programs and equipment
* high schools gain updated STEM and digital learning resources
* residents access well-paying careers in IT, operations, and cloud services
* apprenticeships expand
* talent stays in Wisconsin instead of leaving

This strengthens the middle class and prepares workers for future industries.

---

## 4. Increased Public Value Without Burdening Business

The recommended approach is **voluntary and partnership-driven**, not regulatory or punitive.
This protects Wisconsin’s business-friendly environment while ensuring residents benefit.

The state gains:

* community technology programs
* cloud compute credits
* AI literacy and safety initiatives
* research partnerships
* training resources

…without introducing new taxes or costly mandates.

---

## 5. Early Leadership in AI Governance and Responsible Innovation

By supporting a Wisconsin AI Governance & Safety Institute, the state:

* develops critical expertise in how AI impacts fairness, safety, and public policy
* positions itself as a national model
* gains the ability to evaluate AI tools used in government
* strengthens ethical and transparent technology use

In a tech-driven future, this is as essential as roads and bridges.

---

## 6. More Modern, Efficient Public Institutions

Civic compute credits and partnerships help local and state government agencies:

* optimize operations
* forecast energy and infrastructure needs
* model flood, stormwater, and climate impacts
* improve emergency response
* streamline permits and services
* power next-generation public dashboards

These improvements normally require expensive software or consultants.
With partnerships, they become accessible statewide.

---

## 7. Inclusive Growth for Rural and Urban Communities

Technological investment often concentrates in metro areas.
This stance ensures **benefits are distributed statewide**, through:

* digital literacy centers in rural libraries
* workforce programs at regional technical colleges
* compute access for small municipalities
* community seminars and parent-education programs
* public health and emergency forecasting in rural counties

This promotes **balanced, statewide prosperity**.

---

## 8. A Stronger, Diversified Economic Identity

Wisconsin is historically known for manufacturing, agriculture, and logistics.
A tech-forward stance allows the state to add:

* data infrastructure
* AI governance leadership
* cloud services expertise
* digital education hubs
* university-led research
* tech-enabled public services

This diversification makes Wisconsin more resilient against economic downturns.

---

## 9. Higher Community Trust and Transparency

When residents see companies contributing to community wellbeing—through education programs, public reporting, and direct engagement—trust increases.

This prevents the backlash seen in other states and:

* improves communication
* reduces misinformation
* increases support for responsible development
* ensures community voices are included

This is essential for multi-decade projects.

---

## 10. A Long-Term Legacy That Outlasts Any Individual Project

Even if:

* the AI market changes
* companies retool
* compute demands shift
* facilities downsize

…the **skills, institutions, digital capacity, and infrastructure** that Wisconsin builds through these partnerships will remain.

These benefits include:

* educated residents
* modernized public institutions
* improved community resilience
* clean energy additions
* advanced grid infrastructure
* AI governance leadership
* statewide civic computing capacity

This long-term impact far exceeds the value of property tax or construction spending alone.

---

## **Summary: Why This Stance Matters**

Taking a forward-thinking, partnership-oriented approach to data centers ensures that Wisconsin does not become merely a host to massive compute infrastructure. Instead, it becomes a **builder of statewide resilience, opportunity, and technological leadership.**

This stance:

* strengthens communities
* modernizes government
* grows the workforce
* boosts resilience
* enhances the state’s national position
* prepares Wisconsin for the future
* ensures broad, lasting public benefit

**In short: This is how Wisconsin claims the future, rather than having it happen elsewhere.**
