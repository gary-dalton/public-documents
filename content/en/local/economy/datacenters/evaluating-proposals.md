## **Executive Summary**

Wisconsin is entering a pivotal moment in its economic and technological development. With major hyperscale data centers proposed or underway—including investments from Microsoft (Mount Pleasant and Racine/Caledonia), Meta (Beaver Dam), and Vantage/OpenAI/Oracle (Port Washington)—the state faces an opportunity unprecedented in its modern history.

These projects represent **billions of dollars in capital investment**, **decades of operational lifespan**, and **permanent transformations** to the state’s power grid, tax base, digital infrastructure, and workforce landscape. But the question is no longer simply whether the projects should be approved. Instead:

> **What kind of future does Wisconsin want to build—and how can these data centers help create it?**

Data centers alone do not generate a tech ecosystem. They create *infrastructure*. To turn that infrastructure into broad, long-term community benefit, Wisconsin must focus on **digital resilience**, **AI literacy**, **workforce pathways**, and **governance capacity**—the pillars that determine whether the state can thrive in the AI-driven economy.

States nationwide have begun requiring or requesting **community technology benefits (CTBs)** from large data center operators. These are **voluntary partnerships**, not mandates, and include:

* digital literacy centers
* cloud and compute access for civic use
* K–12 and technical college STEM programs
* research collaborations
* public reporting transparency
* community benefits agreements

These concepts are widely accepted and align directly with Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI’s publicly stated commitments to **AI responsibility**, **ethical innovation**, and **community investment**.

Wisconsin has the opportunity to articulate its own version of these programs.

This report recommends that Wisconsin pursue a statewide, future-facing strategy that includes:

1. **Voluntary Community Technology Benefits (CTBs)**

Programs modeled on national best practices and tied to local needs, including AI education, misinformation resilience, and public digital literacy.

2. **Civic Compute Credits**

Cloud or compute access for local governments, schools, nonprofits, and emergency management—expanding digital capabilities across both rural and urban communities.

3. **A Wisconsin AI Governance & Safety Institute**

A University of Wisconsin–anchored partnership dedicated to AI safety, digital governance, model evaluation, workforce development, and public-sector modernization.

4. **Workforce and Apprenticeship Pipelines**

Expanded Data Center Academies, apprenticeships, and technical college partnerships to ensure Wisconsin residents—not just outside contractors—benefit from new tech jobs.

5. **Transparent, statewide standards** for cooling, water use, grid impact modeling, incentive caps, and environmental reporting.

Together, these steps ensure Wisconsin does not become merely a host to massive compute infrastructure, but an **active participant in shaping and harnessing the next technological era**.

Wisconsin can seize this moment to become:

* a **tech-forward, innovation-ready state**,
* a **leader in responsible AI**,
* a **hub for digital resilience**, and
* a **national model for community-centered technology development**.

The choice is not whether Wisconsin will change, but **how** and **to whose benefit**.
This moment will not return.
But if approached strategically, it can define the state’s trajectory for generations.

{{< alert title="Framing Note" color="info" >}}
This analysis is guided by the companion document “The Benefits of a Forward-Thinking Technology Stance for Wisconsin,” which outlines the statewide advantages of embracing a partnership-oriented approach to data center development.

That document articulates the long-term community, workforce, governance, and digital-resilience benefits that inform the recommendations and evaluation criteria used throughout this report.

The present report should be read in conjunction with that guiding benefits overview, which establishes the strategic rationale for Wisconsin’s approach to hyperscale and AI-era infrastructure.

{{< /alert >}}




## **Statewide Context**

Wisconsin is not merely reacting to isolated corporate proposals; it is being asked a deeper strategic question:

> **Does Wisconsin want to be a long-term tech infrastructure state—and if so, under what terms?**

Three forces are driving interest in the state:

1. **Cold climate → improved cooling efficiency**
2. **Stable grid with available land near transmission lines**
3. **Competitive incentive framework (sales tax exemptions, TIF/TID flexibility)**
4. **Proximity to Chicago backbone connectivity**

However, the scale of incoming projects—especially AI training centers—requires the state to proactively shape:

* resource planning
* environmental standards
* incentive discipline
* workforce development
* regional equity

Without a clear policy framework, Wisconsin risks becoming a **price-taker**, not a **value-maker**.

---

## **Risk Scoring Matrix**

This matrix evaluates each project across five categories:

* Financial Risk
* Grid & Energy Risk
* Environmental & Water Risk
* Community & Political Risk
* Strategic Value to Wisconsin

Scoring: **Low / Medium / High / Very High**

| Project                                         | Financial Risk | Grid/Energy Risk | Water/Env Risk | Community/Political Risk | Strategic Value |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| **Microsoft — Mount Pleasant**                  | Medium         | Medium           | Low–Medium     | Medium                   | **High**        |
| **Microsoft — Racine/Caledonia**                | Medium–High    | Medium           | Medium         | High                     | **Medium–High** |
| **Vantage + OpenAI + Oracle — Port Washington** | High           | **High**         | Low–Medium     | Medium                   | **Very High**   |
| **Meta — Beaver Dam**                           | Medium         | Medium           | Low–Medium     | Medium                   | **High**        |

### Key Takeaway

Wisconsin’s *risk profile* is highest at Port Washington (largest load, tenant complexity) and lowest at Mount Pleasant. Beaver Dam and Mount Pleasant have the greatest upside relative to risk.

---

## **Project Analyses**

---

### 1. Microsoft — Mount Pleasant

> *Stable anchor project with high strategic value, moderate risk, and major infrastructure upside.*

#### **Strengths**

* Strong tenant with long-term cloud workload demand
* Data Center Academy partnerships for workforce development

* Are grid upgrades redundant or shared with Mount Pleasant?
* Will closed-loop cooling be mandatory?
* What regional benefits extend to Milwaukee and Racine residents?

---

### 3. Vantage + OpenAI + Oracle — Port Washington (“Stargate”)

> *The highest-risk, highest-impact project in Wisconsin’s history.*

#### **Strengths**

* Massive strategic value: AI R&D, GPU clusters, next-gen compute
* Strong brand cluster (OpenAI + Oracle)
* Potential catalyst for regional clean energy build-out
* Brings high-end technical jobs

#### **Risks**

* **1.3 GW** demand is transformative—larger than entire cities
* Multi-tenant risk: Vantage & OpenAI are not risk-free
* Significant risk of stranded transmission assets
* Public pushback over transmission siting
* Unclear water/heat discharge details

#### **Priority Questions**

* Is the 1.3 GW load firm or speculative?
* Who finances transmission without burdening ratepayers?
* What if OpenAI’s business model shifts or demand collapses?
* What enforceable water and energy transparency standards exist?

---

### 4. Meta — Beaver Dam

> *A mid-scale, well-engineered project with strong environmental design and moderate fiscal risk.*

#### **Strengths**

* Dry cooling → extremely low water use
* 570-acre wetland and prairie restoration plan
* Meta underwriting ~$200M in energy infrastructure

* Are water-positive and dry-cooling commitments legally enforceable?
* What is the long-term impact on Alliant’s resource plan?
* What workforce programs will Meta guarantee locally?
* How will the 570-acre restoration be maintained over decades?

---

## **Cross-Project Findings**

1. **Energy is Wisconsin’s binding constraint**

All four projects require substantial new generation, transmission, or both. Large AI clusters could delay retirements or force new dispatchable resources unless carefully planned.

2. **Water risk is surprisingly low**

Thanks to dry or closed-loop cooling commitments, water use is minimal in operational phases.

3. **Fiscal exposure varies dramatically**

Wisconsin’s sales tax exemption for data-center equipment is functionally uncapped, and GPU refresh cycles amplify this.

4. **Transparency gaps are the most consistent risk**

Each community (Caledonia, Port Washington, Beaver Dam) has expressed concerns about:

* siting
* community engagement
* environmental transparency

**5. Strategic value is real and potentially transformative**

If managed well, these projects position Wisconsin as a cold-climate tech-infrastructure hub with:

* high-wage jobs
* new clean-energy build-out
* modernized transmission
* tech-sector clustering

---

## **Recommendations for Wisconsin**

Wisconsin is receiving an unprecedented wave of hyperscale data-center proposals. These projects can be catalysts for economic renewal — *if* the state pairs them with forward-looking, community-oriented initiatives that strengthen resilience, governance, education, and digital capacity.

See the addittional documents, [Community Technology Partnership Opportunities for Wisconsin](/local/economy/datacenters/benefits-brief.md) and [Wisconsin AI Governance](/local/economy/datacenters/wi-ai-governance.md).

---

### 1. Establish a Statewide Data Center Regulatory Framework

Wisconsin needs consistent, predictable standards that apply to all hyperscale development.
This should include:

* Transparency requirements
* Environmental reporting
* Siting criteria
* Energy-use disclosure
* Water-use limits and technology standards
* Incentive discipline (caps, performance requirements, clawbacks)

This prevents piecemeal negotiations and ensures fairness across regions.

---

### 2. Require “Additionality” in Clean Energy Procurement

To avoid burdening ratepayers or delaying fleet retirements:

* Large data centers should directly fund **new clean energy** that matches or exceeds their load.
* Market-based REC matching should be replaced or supplemented with **new-build renewable + storage commitments**.

This ensures data centers accelerate—not impede—Wisconsin’s decarbonization.

---

### 3. Cap or Restructure the Data Center Sales-Tax Exemption

Current rules create open-ended exposure due to fast GPU refresh cycles.

Wisconsin should adopt:

* Per-project caps
* Multi-year sunset and renewal
* Distinction between *refresh* vs *expansion*
* Optional performance-based exemption tied to public benefits

This is a risk-management tool, not an anti-tech policy.

---

### 4. Mandate Closed-Loop or Dry Cooling for Large Facilities

Hyperscale water use outside Wisconsin is enormous, but here companies have already adopted low-water or no-water designs.

Wisconsin should **codify** this best practice.

This protects shared water resources and avoids future disputes.

---

### 5. Implement Reversion Clauses for Grid & Infrastructure Assets

If a project downsizes or is canceled, Wisconsin should retain:

* substations
* transformers
* transmission infrastructure
* fiber conduits
* water and sewer upgrades

These assets can support future employers and manufacturing expansions.

---

### 6. Create a Statewide Workforce & Education Pipeline

Data centers offer modest but high-quality operations jobs, and substantial construction work.
Wisconsin should require participating companies to:

* Fund apprenticeships
* Support technical college partnerships
* Build K–12 STEM and digital literacy programs
* Contribute to rural + urban talent pipelines

This aligns hyperscale growth with long-term workforce needs.

---

### 7. Encourage Voluntary Community Technology Benefits (CTBs)

Wisconsin can work with companies to establish **voluntary, partnership-based community benefits** aligned with the operators’ own public commitments to:

* AI responsibility
* safety
* digital literacy
* community good

These are not mandates — they are *collaborative programs*.

#### CTB examples:

* Digital literacy centers in libraries and community hubs
* Funding for local cybersecurity and AI-misinformation resilience
* Training resources for parents, educators, and nonprofits
* Public dashboards on energy and water usage
* Equipment donations for rural schools and technical colleges

This ensures community value extends beyond property-tax revenue.

---

###  8. Establish a “Civic Compute Credit” Program (Voluntary Partnership)

Data center operators or cloud providers can allocate **computational access** to:

* municipalities
* universities
* emergency response agencies
* public health departments
* K–12 districts
* nonprofits
* tribal governments

Uses:

* advanced energy modeling
* CHRYSALIS-style physical systems simulations
* Promethean-style process optimization
* flood/heat-response modeling
* infrastructure planning
* workforce forecasting
* ethical/tamper-resistant public-service AI tools

This helps Wisconsin leapfrog other states in public-sector innovation.

---

### 9. Support the Creation of a Wisconsin AI Governance & Safety Institute

This draws directly from your Evangelion/CHRYSALIS/Promethean framework.

The Institute would:

* Research AI safety, governance, bias, and transparency
* Develop model-evaluation tools
* Support policymakers with evidence-based guidance
* Offer training for public servants
* Build statewide digital resilience
* Serve as a hub for responsible innovation

Companies investing in Wisconsin data centers already fund similar institutes elsewhere — this is a natural fit.

---

### 10. Create Innovation & Ethics Districts Near Major Data Center Sites

These districts could host:

* community tech spaces
* workforce training labs
* university satellite research facilities
* STEM incubators
* shared civic compute access pods
* public-sector innovation offices

These districts turn data center anchors into **innovation ecosystems**.

---

### 11. Require Annual Public AI & Digital-Impact Reports

To foster transparency and build trust:

* data center operators publish public-facing reports on

  * energy usage
  * water usage
  * carbon impact
  * AI safety initiatives
  * community investments
  * workforce outcomes

This mirrors what they already publish globally.

---

### 12. Implement Statewide Community Engagement Standards

To avoid local backlash:

* early disclosure of siting plans
* environmental impact communication
* town halls
* annual community briefings
* accessible summaries of PSC filings

This prevents local distrust and improves project predictability.
