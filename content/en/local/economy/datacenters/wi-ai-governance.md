{{< alert title="Framing Note" color="info" >}}
This analysis is guided by the companion document “The Benefits of a Forward-Thinking Technology Stance for Wisconsin,” which outlines the statewide advantages of embracing a partnership-oriented approach to data center development.

That document articulates the long-term community, workforce, governance, and digital-resilience benefits that inform the recommendations and evaluation criteria used throughout this report.

The present report should be read in conjunction with that guiding benefits overview, which establishes the strategic rationale for Wisconsin’s approach to hyperscale and AI-era infrastructure.
