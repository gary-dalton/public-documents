A livable and sustainable city is key to our well-being and happiness as a species. These things are not the exclusionary domain of one group of citizens but meant to be availble to all.

Some potential future discussions

* Any thoughts on evictions? https://evictionlab.org/map/?m=modeled&c=p&b=efr&s=all&r=counties&y=2018&z=4.26&lat=39.14&lon=-99.44&lang=en now has coast to coast data.

* The first public school in the colonies was in 1635. Public education has been deemed important throughout our history because, especially in a participatory democracy, a well educated populace is essential to the functioning of our society. Do you disagree with that?
