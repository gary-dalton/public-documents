I think there is a strong connection between having livable cities and maintaing our environment. There should be a clear spectrum from dense city to _the wild_. In fact the more dense we are able to make our livable cities the easier it is to bring _the wild_ closer to more people.

Over time I hope to bring ideas to these sections.
