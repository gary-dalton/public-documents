## What is Ceviche?

Ceviche is made of fish or shellfish marinated in citrus and seasonings. Different versions of ceviche are part of the culinary culture of various Spanish-American countries along the Pacific Ocean. In Peru it is considered a flagship dish and cultural heritage.

Traditionally, a raw white fish, such as sea bass, is used but many times this is replaced with a cooked shrimp. The versions I make include cooked shrimp or, contrary to tradition, leftover grilled salmon. A cooked whitefish such as tilapia would work well also. The spiciness of the dish is determined by the type and quantity of chile used.

## Servings

About 6

## Ingredients

* 1/2 red onion, chopped
* 1 tsp salt
* 3/4 cup  lime juice (4-6 limes)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 lb cooked shrimp, chopped (I'll sometimes use leftover grilled salmon)
* 1 cup diced tomatoes
* 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1 avocado, diced
* 1 finely chopped jalapeno

## Preparation

1. Chop the onion
2. Juice the limes and add into bowl with onion and salt
3. Add garlic, shrimp, tomatoes, and jalepeno
4. Chill in refrigerator for about 30 minutes (more is fine as often I'll prepare in the morning)
5. About 1/2 hour before serving, add the cilantro and avocado.
6. Chill until serving

## Serve

Serve with tostadoes (Mexican style), cooked sweet potatotes or plantains (peruvian style), or with quinoa and greens.
