description: "A tasty chipolte based version of chili. My very own interpretation of chili. Designed for a contest as both different than the typical American version of chili and also delicious. This chili, or a version of it, will be entered in next year's Chili Bowl contest."

## Ingredients

* 1-2 cups [Chipolte sauce]({{< ref "chipotle-sauce.md" >}}) (use less for a milder spice)
<br /><br />

* 1.5 pounds Ground beef
* 1 Tablespoon Olive oil
* 1 Onion (chopped)
<br /><br />

* 4 cloves Garlic
* 2 inches Ginger
* 1.5 teaspoons Cumin seed
* 1/2 teaspoon Tumeric
* 1.5 teaspoons Spanish paprika
* 1 teaspoon Cinnamon
<br /><br />

* 2 cans Diced tomatoes
* 3 cans Beans (black, pinto, northern, etc)
* 2 teaspoons Molasses
* 1/2 bag Frozen corn (about 6 ounces)
* 1 cup Water (add more as needed for consistency)
* 1/2 cup Cilantro chopped
* 1/2 bottle Beer



## Preparation

Using a large pot:

**Step 1** Brown the beef in olive oil then add the onion to brown.

Ground the garlic, ginger, and dry spices in a spice grinder. You'll end up with a spice-paste mixture.

**Step 2** Add the Chipolte sauce, spice-paste, tomatoes, beans, molasses, corn, and water. Heat to a mild boil.

Add the cilantro and 1/2 of whatever beer you are enjoying. Lower heat to a simmer. Let simmer for about 2 hours and enjoy.
