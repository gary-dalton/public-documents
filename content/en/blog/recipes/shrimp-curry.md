## Serve

Serve immediately with **½ cup cooked Protein Grain Medley** per person  
(*Instant Pot: 1 cup green lentils + 1 cup quinoa + 3 cups water · High Pressure 9 min · Natural Release 10 min*).  

The Protein Grain Medley provides superior **protein, fiber, minerals, and sustainable plant-based nutrition** compared to rice, while pairing perfectly with the curry’s texture and flavor.

**Optional enhancements:**

- Stir **¼ tsp turmeric** into the cooked Medley (activates with the heat of the curry).  
- Add **fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon** just before serving.  
- Add **a handful of spinach directly to the hot Medley** — it wilts instantly and boosts lutein, folate, and prebiotic fiber.
