# Lamb Cabbage Rolls

Serves 6-8

## Ingredients

- 1 large head green cabbage (or savoy cabbage)

### For the Filling
- 1 lb lean ground lamb (90% lean if available)  
- 1 cup cooked whole grain  or 1/2 cup uncooked white rice
  *(choose one: barley, farro, millet, or brown rice)*  
- 5 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 tablespoons chopped ginger (about 2 inch piece)
- 1 large egg 
- 1–2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 1/2 teaspoons tumeric

### For the Broth
- 5 ounces shredded carrots
- 8 ounces mushrooms
- 1 bunch green onions
- 1 bunch fresh parsley
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1–2 tablespoons fresh **lemon juice**

### Garnish
- Lemon wedge  
- Sesame oil drizzle


## Preparation

### Step 1

Boil a large pot of water with some salt. 

Remove for use the outer 12 leaves of cabbage, (save the rest for another meal). Once boiling, lower the heat to medium, maintaining a gentle boil. Add a few cabbage leaves and cook until tender and flexible, about 2 minutes. Remove and allow to cool on paper towel. Repeat until all 12 leaves are cooked. Retain the liquid.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

### Step 2

Prepare the meat filling by combining and mixing by hand the following ingredients in a large boil. Combine the lamb, grain, egg, garlic, ginger, tumeric, pepper, and soy sauce.

### Step 3

In a large dutch oven style pot place the assembled the cabbage rolls. Assemble each cabbage roll by placing about 1/12 of the filling mixture into each leaf and rolling the leaf. Roll the leaf by folding the stem over the filling, rolling it tightly to the top, and then fold the ends over the seam. Place the roll into the pot with the seam side facing down.

### Step 4

Pour the vegetable broth over the cabbage rolls. Add shredded carrots, mushrooms, green onions, soy sauce, lemon juice, and parsley. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Use the retained cabbage liquid to insure that the rolls are well covered by liquid.

### Step 5

Once boiling cover the pan and place it in the oven for about 45 minutes.

### Serving

Serve the cabbage rolls in a bowl with broth mixture. Drizzle with sesame oil.

### Extra Spice

Slice your favorite chile into the broth at step 4.
