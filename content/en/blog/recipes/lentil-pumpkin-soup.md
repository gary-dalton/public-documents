- 1 tablespoon garam masala  
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more to taste)  
- 1 1/2 cups red lentils, rinsed  
- 15-ounce can pure pumpkin purée  
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup  
- 6 cups vegetable broth  
- **Salt:**  
  - Classic: **1 tablespoon**  
  - EAT–Lancet Option: **1–2 teaspoons**  

### Optional Final Seasonings
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (Classic)  
- 2 teaspoons maple syrup  
- 1 teaspoon garam masala  
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon  
- **Pepitas** (green, shelled pumpkin seeds), for topping  
- **Fresh lemon juice** (1–2 teaspoons per bowl)

### Optional EAT–Lancet Enhancements
- Add **2 cups chopped vegetables** (spinach, bell pepper, carrot, tomato)  
- Use **reduced-sodium vegetable broth**

### Optional Longevity Enhancements (Anti-Aging)
- Stir **¼ teaspoon turmeric** + a pinch of black pepper into the soup at the end  
- Add **fresh lemon juice** before serving

### Recommended Grain Pairings

- **Millet** — Light, fluffy, neutral; complements the soup without overpowering  
- **Farro** — Rich, nutty, chewy; adds hearty texture for a more substantial bowl  
- **Wild Rice** — Earthy, aromatic, slightly chewy; pairs beautifully with pumpkin and warm spices  

Each of these grains is fully **EAT–Lancet aligned**, longevity-supportive, and sustainable.
