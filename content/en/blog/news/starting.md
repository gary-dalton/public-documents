During this crazy time of corona virus quarantine, I figured it is time to get some things done. One of those is updating my documentation efforts. I was last using a system based upon asciidoc, pandoc, and git, with some work done in markdown and hugo. It worked fairly well but was cumbersome in many regards. I last reviewed methods in 2018, which was prior to my restarting school in Mathematics.

So this new site uses markdown instead of asciidoc. There are many similarities but markdown is more ubiquitous. Hugo, when joined with github and a static site service provider like render, makes updating a breeze. Just push!

So, I am not really a conversationalist. Here is the site, enjoy!
