I was going through old files the other day and came across some notes I had made. These covered my business mission and core values as I created and stated them when I started doing business in the mid 1990s.

## Mission Statement

_Be happy and cause happiness_

That is a very simple and direct statement and I hope that over the ensuing years, I was able to cause happiness for my customers and everyone I worked with. I also hope that I continue with this mission statement in my personal life as well.

## Core Values

### Competence

Do things well and efficiently

### Understanding

Strive to understand people, systems, situations, and life.

### Objectivity

Remove or at least reduce egocentricity. This is important of understanding and competence.

### Collaboration

Others exist and must be included as stakeholders in all projects. Success in an endeavor is not the completion alone but the resulting creation of happiness. Without collaboration, this becomes impossible.

### Adaptability

Easily and quickly abandon failure and consistently follow the path of what works.

### Integrity

To thine own self, remain true. Do not sacrifice this mission or values in order to make ephemeral gains.

## Conclusion

Honestly, I really like these even today. I do hope that I was able to follow this mission and stick to those values. I will try to keep them in mind as I move forward with my life. I think that they are just as worthwhile for me as an individual as for the businesses I created.
