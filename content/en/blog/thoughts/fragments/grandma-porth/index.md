Grandma Porth taught me cards and other games. While I don't really play many games now, the lessons of probability I learned from her teaching have remained. She was a world traveler who loved new experiences and cultures. Her dedication to community service and the well-being of all those around her set an excellent example.

Sometimes, she seemed the iron lady but I spent many, many hours with her and the ironess was only displayed when needed. I am glad that she mostly missed my lost years but wish she could she who I have become because I think she played a significant role in my life.

(this is likely the hardest of these for me to write)
