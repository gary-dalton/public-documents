linkTitle:  "Fragments"
description: "Fragments of my life which include gratitudes given to people and lessons learned, core ideas,  and undeveloped thoughts. These fragments loosely follow the model of discourse followed by Marcus Aurelius in his Meditations. They are fully my own work. The fragments are not intended to be complete discussions of an idea and will not include references."
