It is important to practice good habits of the mind at all times. Why? When we are not actively practicing good habits, we may lazily fall into bad habits. Bad habits are formed of the aggregate of our lives mixed with the cement of our passions, heavily reinforced by repetition, and cured over long periods of time. Our bad habits are very hard to break, requiring the sturdy spike of iron will and regular strikes with the heavy hammer of our effort. They take time to form and time to break.

Knowing the ease in which bad habits take hold, we should be generous to ourselves and to others struggling with the load of their accumulated habits.

Good habits are also strong and will support us in the most difficult of endeavors.
