## Introduction

This is from a page I found in an old notebook. Likely circa 1978-1980. I tried to record this verbatim from the handwritten text. Take from it what you will.

## Anchored

Everyone trying to beat the clown

Each crowd flying higher than you

yet anchored to the bottom of me

---

## Popular Grasp

A man tries to escape from the popular grasp

What he can't see is he's the fist

grabbing his own ass to do the task

---

## Searching

Everyones looking for the One

Searching the world for the Man to change

He can't be found neither here nor there

For the One to be, the Man to change

has lost his way on the changing wave

His mind has gone from there to here

That's backwards! Now he's nowhere

Fighting his way through the mighty trees

All he finds is that the trees are blades of grass

My god where am I! that's his cry

Silence that's all you hear and say

No one cares where the fool has gone

He's been forgotten from all the searching
