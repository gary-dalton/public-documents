## Introduction

This is from a page I found in an old notebook. Likely circa 1978-1980. I tried to record this verbatim from the handwritten text. Take from it what you will.

## Shine

Brilliance exists in all of us

but in some of us there is more

and in others it is closer to the surface

For the some and the others it loses its shine

through constant exposure to the unimportant

Therefore the greatest brillinace is control

of the real priorities and not those we imagine

## Boredom

I am relatively inexperienced and ingnorant

but even in my present state

boredom exists

If boredom can exist there must be non-boredom, 

this is the final goal where all is fresh
