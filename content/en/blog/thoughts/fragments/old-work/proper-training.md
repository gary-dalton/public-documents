## Introduction

This is from a page I found in an old notebook. Let's just say I was unsatisfied with the life and world I saw around me. Likely circa 1978. I tried to record this verbatim from the handwritten text. Take from it what you will.

## Present System Proper Training

Imperfect System doesn't work properly but
1. basics
2. teach ability to learn
3. teach limits of this society by reinforcement and punishment (neccessarily incomplete because of prior learning)
4. punish all discovered deviants
    - rehabilitate if possible
    - if not possible remove from society permanently
5. limits are never completely learned therefore contiually push old limits but allow new limits some room to grow
6. New social order now takes over and teaches youth processes 1-5

## New System Proper Training

1. basics
2. teach ability to learn
3. Teach present limits of society but stress impermanence of these limits
4. Place all deviants in positions profitable to
    - present society
    - change, for future society
5. Teach futures especially 'supposedly' profitable deviants process of 1-4

## Additional notes

This is hard for me because the system taught me to learn but not when to stop learning
