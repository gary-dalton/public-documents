## Introduction

This is from a page I found in an old notebook. Let's just say I was unsatisfied with the life and world I saw around me. Likely circa 1978. I tried to record this verbatim from the handwritten text. Take from it what you will.

## The Revolution

1. **Money** (may neccessitate multicorp involement) _many paths?_
2. **Diversifications and Matuaration** According to System. _difficult_
3. **Power Play on Nukes** _follows_
4. **Out of Spotlight & Let System Run its Course** _follows_
5. **Protect Diversification**
6. **Consolidation & Consolidated Diversification**
7. **Update Maturation** (Includes Spacing) _must not stagnate_
8. **Expand New System**
9. **Eliminate excess population** _if any_
10. **End Result to be Continually updated**

### Laws to be eliminated in Present System

1. All victimless crimes
2. Present unequal tax laws
3. Present Health Care System
