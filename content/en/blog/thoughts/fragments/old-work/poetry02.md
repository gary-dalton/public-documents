## Introduction

This is from a page I found in an old notebook. Likely circa 1978-1980. I tried to record this verbatim from the handwritten text. Take from it what you will. This one gives me a Pink Floyd vibe.

## Grinder

As the world goes up

and as the world goes down

All the people just spin around

wildly chasing their dreams to the ground

They say they know where they're going

I say they've forgotten where they've been

The crowd is full of fools

but which one are you?

Are you the one who wastes his time on 'me'

or the one who loves his god with great hypocrisy

Each despises the other from fear of being alike

There are those who are sincere and feel they're real

fulfilling their purpose on this tiny desolate planet

What a laugh, they are a part of the whole

Can't you see through this deadly farce

your life is mine and mine is not yours?

Individuals become nonexistent by the belief of 'I can change the world'

as they get closer and closer to the bottom of the grining machine

It cuts you into little pieces

and scatters you throught the whole

Which is better us or 'me' its hard to say.
