## Introduction

This is from a page I found in an old notebook. A little newer than some of the others, based upon handwriting. Likely circa 1980-1982. I tried to record this verbatim from the handwritten text. Take from it what you will.

## Truth

The worls is so unknowingly old

and I so unbearably young

How can I expect to learn every fold
<br />
<br />
<br />
Must I search for the infinite truth

or that which lurks within our reach
<br />
<br />
<br />
We must learn to try

and try to learn

that which is real and sometimes true

for what is true for you

may not be for me 'til death is near

and all is through
