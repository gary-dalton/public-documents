## Why do we have government?

Basically governments exist to organize. A basic family group has it own organization that is not formalized. As we move from a single family group to a tribe of families and then to a organization of many tribes; we see the need to formalize structure to reduce internal conflict and to meet objectives.

What types of objectives would these groupings wish to achieve? I think it is best to start with basic survival. Generally, this will include: food extraction, food cultivation, resource extraction, resource distribution, self-defense, resource acquisition, and dispute mediation. Especially note that the last three items often include the use of force. In the modern world, some of these objectives are not performed by a government but instead by various legal structures from sole proprietor to multi-national corporation.

The main intent and purpose of a government is the survival of its constituent members. Who are these constituent members? Typically, we consider the constituent members to be those who have the ability to direct the actions of the government. In the US, this would involve all persons who hold the right to vote. In an absolute monarchy, the monarch, as the embodiment of the state, is the focal point to exercise government powers. Of course there are many other persons who exert influence and derive benefit but these benefits flow from their relationship to the monarch.

Even in a representative democracy, such as the US, the right to vote may change radically over time. It started with white land-owning men, then was expanded to white men, to all men, and then on to all men and women who are born in the US or naturalized as a citizen.

Tuesday, we watched the documentary "The Kingmaker" (excellent by the way). I asked Becca why she thought people were still supporting the Marcos and this evolved to a discussion on why we pick which leaders and representatives.
She stated that she would watch a debate without sound to pick out body language and interactions. I stated I thought that made the most important criteria something that is best performed by an actor. And it would eliminate highly qualified candidates that don't present very well.
Anyway, here is my ranking criteria in order of importance:
1. Truth and transparency (we need accurate data to make good choices)
2. Ability to collaborate (nothing big can be done alone)
3. Decision-making process (diversity of opinion and welcoming of criticism, decisions must be intellectually battle tested)
4. Communication skills (need to be able to communicate decisions and reasons)
5 Does policy and ideology match mine (if it is close, I would expect the person to make fair choices)
I'm still trying to understand the dynamics that lead Filipinos to support members of the Marcos family. There is something important in that.
