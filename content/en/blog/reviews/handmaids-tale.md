# The Handmaid's Tale

*by Margaret Atwood*

**4 Stars**

This is a dystopian fiction novel that has a Netflix series derived from it.

## My Review

This is not the sort of book I would normally seek out but this and The Three Body Problem were recommended to me ... so.

The world of the The Handmaid's Tale is not a fun world in which to live. The author does an excellent job in conveying the tone of monotony and oppression. A well written novel.

We are welcomed to the US after a hostile coup by an extreme fundamentalist Christian group that institutes a rule of, by, and for, elite males. Women are subjugated and all must be watchful for the secret police.

The novel is written as a series of extracts as if from a diary. This is a style that I like very much. It provides personal insight but limited worldview which is very appropriate.

The colors assignments and daily structure are thoughtfully written. I do hope that humanity would not so easily succumb to this sort of a takeover and fear that I would not live in this world.

Yes, read the *The Handmaid's Tale* and let's make certain that we remain an enlightened populace.
