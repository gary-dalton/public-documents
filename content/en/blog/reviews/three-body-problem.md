# The Three Body Problem

*by Liu Cixin*

**4 Stars**

This is a science fiction novel by a Chinese author that has won a number of awards. It is a very good science fiction story.

## My Review

I definitely enjoy the changed perspective of the Chinese author. It gave the story a very different feel, yet still connected to humanity. There is background story which starts during the Cultural Revolution. The main characters are scientific intellectuals, usually in the field of physics, and often professors. so the language used is somewhat technical but usually not too much to distract from the flow of the story.

I thought the story in the first half to three fourths of the book was excellent. The setup of the main characters was well done. The use of the virtual reality video game was appropriate and engaging. It was shortly after Wang is brought into the ETO that the story seems to not know where to go and becomes much more generic. This is when the story directly confronts the ongoing role of the alien civilization invasion plans.

Additionally, I found the concept of unfolding dimensions to be interesting but that the implementation in the sophons to be a bit ludicrous. I also thought the book did a poor job of explaining the motivations of those involved in the ETO, though a valiant attempt was made.

*The Three Body Problem* is definitely a book to read, especially for those who like science fiction. I used to be a big fan of this genre but have found it a struggle to read for the past 30 years. This book was not a struggle, in fact it is well written and puts forth some interesting ideas.
