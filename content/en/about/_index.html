<p>This site is about the documents. I write documents in many of the topics with which I am familiar, some which extend my learning, and some which are basically a log of the steps I took. Typically, these will cover topics such as:</p>

<p>Machine learning | Mathematics, especially probability and analysis | Digital services | Maker projects | Vision systems | Raspberry pi | Compute environments | and others</p>

<p>I am currently a graduate student in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. After having spent 20+ years in the IT industry as a service provider, I decided it was time to take things to the next level. By next level, I mean develop a deep understanding of the mathematics in the fast developing world of machine learning.</p>

<p>In the field of AI, I have the opinion that it is very important to do it right the first time. We will often get results that are difficult or impossible to understand and interpret. If the underlying math that leads to these results is not provable, we could easily end up in a situation of causing harm instead of creating good.</p>
