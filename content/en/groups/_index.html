<h2>In Support of Community Groups</h2>

{{% /blocks/lead %}}

{{< blocks/section >}}
<h3>A collaborative space for your group's documentation and knowledge.</h3>
<p>Welcome! This space is dedicated to supporting local and online community groups by providing a free and powerful platform to host your documentation, guides, and shared knowledge. If you run a meetup, a user group, or a collaborative project, you can use this site as a centralized resource for your members.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Our goal is to make collaboration simple and transparent. This entire site is managed through GitHub, a standard tool for modern collaborative work. Approved groups can do pull requests to contribute to a dedicated section. This allows your members to write and edit content, suggest changes, and maintain your group's knowledge base using a straightforward, version-controlled workflow.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>There are a few simple requirements to get your group set up.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Contact me:</b> The first step is to get in touch. We'll discuss your group's needs and make sure this is the right fit for you.</li>
  <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/gary-dalton/public-documents/issues/new?title=Community%20Group%20Access" target="_blank">Create a github issue</a> asking for "Community Group Access". Include some information about your group and why you would like access. I will get back to you within about a week.</li></ul>
  <li><b>GitHub Account:</b> All contributors will need a free GitHub account. This is essential for managing edits and contributions.</li>
  <li><b>Markdown Knowledge:</b> Content for the site is written in Markdown, a simple and easy-to-learn syntax for formatting text.</li>
  <li><b>Extra:</b> Knowing Hugo and Docsy, upon which this site is based, will supercharge your experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>We're excited to provide a space for groups to grow and share their work. If you're interested in building your group's public knowledge base, please reach out!</p>
