## What is the Ladder Challenge?

The goal is simple: challenge your way to the top and defend your rank or rung on the singles ladder. Challenge an opponent already on the ladder and play a Singles match to 15 points and report your score to climb the ladder.

## Viewing the Ladder

There are multiple paths to view the ladder:

1. From the Dashboard:
    - If the global info shows, just click the Ladder Challenge link
    - Otherwise scroll to and click Tournaments.
    <br />
    <br />

    - From here you should see all of your activities. This is your Ladder Dashboard.
    - You have options to Challenge, Cancel, Accept, Enter scores, or Dispute a score. These only show if they are available to you.

## What is a Ranked Player?

If you are in the Ladder Challenge you are ranked. The initial ranking were determined from some end-of-year singles matches prior to the first season.

Subsequent year inital rankings will carry forward from your end-of-season rank.

If you are not in the Ladder Challenge, you are not ranked. It is easy to join this tournament and get ranked. See below, _Making Challenges: As an unranked player_.
