This section is a conglomeration of all the documentation I create. Most documents, I create in order to recall and share what I have done. Much of it is procedural, such as how I built my [Document system](/docs/document-system/). Document system, first discusses the need, then lists the packages used, and finally goes step by step on installation. One reason for this is so that I may repeat the exact same installation in the future.
