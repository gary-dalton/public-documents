Good morning, everyone! Great to see so many of you here, ready to hit the greens.

Before we start, Scott asked me to update you on this summer’s **Mixed Pairs Bowling Tournament!**

Now, why should you care? Well, this tournament is a fantastic opportunity to dive into some fun, competitive bowling and to team up with fellow club members you might not have had the chance to bowl with before. It’s all about mixing it up, making new connections, and enjoying some great competition.

Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to know:

* **The Teams:** Each team will be composed of one male and one female member. If you’re keen to play but don’t have a partner lined up yet, please don’t worry! Just let the tournament director know, and we’ll do our best to help pair you up.

* **Tournament Kick-off:** The action officially starts on **June 15th!**

* **The Format – Fun & Flexible:**

  * We’ll begin with a round-robin pool play stage. Teams will be seeded by perceived strength into two pools – Pool A and Pool B – to ensure balanced competition right from the start.

  * Within your pool, you'll play one match against every other team.  You and your opponents to schedule these pool matches, IN ANY ORDER, at mutually agreed-upon dates and times, anytime before the **end of July**. So, there's plenty of flexibility!

  * You’ll earn 2 points for a win, and 1 point for a tie.

* **Advancing to the Knockouts:**

  * The top two teams from each pool, based on those accumulated points, will advance to the double elimination champions stage!

  * A turnout  of 10 to 12 teams would be fantastic, but the more, the merrier! And, depending on the number of teams who register, we’re might get creative with the knockout stage, based on pool results.

* **The Championship Stage:** We’ll have semi-finals and then the grand final. In these matches, there are no ties – if it’s level after regulation ends, we’ll play an extra end to determine the winner. We’ll have matches to determine the top 3 finishers.

* **Prizes!** Of course, there will be prizes! The payout structure will be determined by the number of teams participating.

We are really looking forward to an exciting summer of bowling with this new tournament. It’s a chance to challenge yourselves, enjoy the competitive spirit, and build camaraderie within the club.

We’ll be promoting this more in the **early June Hogline** and through **weekly in-person announcements** here at the club for the first three weeks of June.

So, start thinking about who you’d like to team up with! If you have any questions at all, please talk to Scott or I sometime today.

Let’s get ready to roll into a fantastic summer of Mixed Pairs action!
